# TriviaGame

### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

* A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question will display.  

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the player will see that time's up and will see the correct answer. Player will then wait a few seconds, then will see the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be told they selected the wrong option and then will see the correct answer. The player will wait a few seconds, then will see the next question.

* On the final screen, the player will see the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
